# Belly Button Biodiversity

This project consists of building an interactive dashboard to explore the <a href="http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/" target="_blank">Belly Button Biodiversity dataset</a>, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

please visit the final <a href="https://eabouche.github.io/belly-button-challenge/" target="_blank">Belly Button Biodiversity interactive dashboard</a> to analyze the test samples within the dataset.
